		{
			"question": "What is Faithful? How did it come to be?",
			"answer": "Faithful is a project spanning several Minecraft resource packs bearing the same name. The aim of Faithful is to provide a higher-resolution experience while still maintaining the look and feel of the vanilla textures. \nFaithful was originally started by Vattic in 2010, and since then he has given the current Faithful Administration the authority to maintain and update the pack officially.",
			"keywords": ["faithful", "about"]
		},
		{
			"question": "What were the Compliance and Emulated Vattic projects?",
			"answer": "The Faithful project was initially called Compliance, prior to when we had received approval from Vattic to continue Faithful under his brand. In addition, Classic Faithful was an entirely separate project called Emulated Vattic Textures (EM for short), but merged with the Faithful Project and adopted the Classic Faithful name during the Faithful rebrand. \nEssentially, Faithful and Compliance are one and the same, and Classic Faithful and Emulated Vattic are one and the same.",
			"keywords": ["compliance", "emulated vattic", "em", "rebrand"]
		},
		{
			"question": "Who is Kraineff, who is Vattic, and why are there two Faithfuls?",
			"answer": "After Vattic created the original Faithful 32x32 in 2010, he eventually was forced to abandon the project in 2016 due to uncontrollable and unfortunate circumstances in his life. A few months after, an artist named Kraineff (also known as xMrVizzy) claimed that Vattic passed control of the pack to him, and continued Faithful, seemingly officially. \nWhile Kraineff made increasingly questionable decisions and people started questioning his legitimacy, after a breaking point in November 2020 all of his contributors left him behind to start their own project, called Compliance. Around a month later, these contributors gained contact with Vattic, confirming their suspicions that Vattic never authorized Kraineff to continue Faithful, essentially meaning that Kraineff had been profiting off a stolen name for over 4 years and had been lying about ownership the whole time. If you're interested in this part of the story, you should watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgZYBTlwaVs) for more information. \nHowever, afterwards when it was clear that Kraineff was never going to willingly relinquish the Faithful name to the now-official Compliance project, the Compliance project rebranded to Faithful in April 2022, causing there to be two Faithfuls.",

		{

This means that there are no hard deadlines for a given pack to be completed for a new version. However, you can usually use an [experimental build](https://database.faithfulpack.net/packs/) of the pack in the mean time, which may include missing textures. \nIf you want to help out with pack progress, read the [Contributor's Handbook](https://docs.faithfulpack.net/pages/textures/contributor-handbook) and inquire in the pack's respective Discord for more information.",

		{

			"answer": "Unfortunately, getting resource packs onto the marketplace is a lengthy and complicated process, and a free pack hasn't been published to the marketplace yet. As well as this, community packs are disallowed from the marketplace, as there would be no fair way to compensate everyone involved otherwise monetarily. We would like to eventually release Faithful on the marketplace if possible, but if releasing a free resource pack on the marketplace is not possible, we will not release Faithful there.",

		{
			"question": "What's the difference between Faithful and Classic Faithful?",
			"answer": "The difference is in the art style, not in the textures that are being upscaled.

		{
			"question": "What are Jappa and Programmer Art textures?",
			"answer": "*JAPPA* is the online nickname of Jasper Boerstra, Minecraft's lead artist and the author of the majority of textures used in versions 1.14 and newer. The \"new\" Minecraft textures are often called Jappa textures in his honour. \nProgrammer Art (oftentimes abbreviated as \"progart\" or \"PA\") is the name given by Mojang and used by the Minecraft artist community for the old textures, used in Minecraft prior to release 1.14. It's also the name of the built-in resource pack featured in newer versions that contains the old textures.\n*Whether a texture is Jappa or Programmer Art is not related to its pixel resolution (e.g. 16x16, 32x, 64x).*",

		{
			"question": "What is the difference between 16x, 32x, and 64x?",
			"answer": "\"32x\" means the textures, as a base, are 32 by 32 pixels (rather than default's 16 by 16 pixels). \"64x\" means the textures are 64 by 64 pixels. Higher numbers mean higher resolution textures.

To submit textures, upload them to the appropriate submission channel (the file has to have the same name as the default texture), and the bot will take over from there and format it for you. Any text you include with the message will be added as a comment, and people pinged in the comment will be added as co-authors. \nFor your texture to be added to the pack, it must pass a round of community voting (lasting 2 days) and a round of private Art Director Council voting (lasting one day). \nFor Classic Faithful, the submission process is exactly the same but only takes one day of community voting and no council vote instead.",

			"question": "What's the difference between an add-on and a tweak?",
			"answer": "We define the differences in the following way: \n**Tweak**: A Tweak changes existing aspects about the game. They are one-off and smaller than an Add-on ‚Äì changes of multiple themes should not be grouped into one Tweak. Examples: 3D items, Consistent Bedrock. \n**Add-on**: An Add-on adds new features to the game, and/or is usually larger in scope than a Tweak. Examples: New random variations for blocks/mobs. \nAdditionally, due to technical limitations, PBR resource packs cannot reuse textures from the main Faithful pack, and therefore can function as standalone ‚Äì but for the sake of simplicity, they are also considered Add-ons. \nLastly, collections of Tweaks that the author chooses not to submit individually are considered Add-ons as well.",

		{
			"question": "Will Faithful affect my FPS?",
			"answer": "The short answer is no. While ludicrously high-resolution packs may cause a minor decrease (well above the scope of the Faithful project), in general shaders are the major graphics-related culprit for causing large amounts of lag, not resource packs. When a resource pack claims to boost FPS, there's a good chance it's completely lying or it will cause a very marginal increase at best.",
