		description: 'Compliance is a Minecraft resource pack available in 32x and 64x resolutions, aiming to provide higher-resolution textures while staying true to the vanilla Minecraft textures. We initially had a breakaway project from Faithful after some disagreements with the owner, but have since moved on and are our own, completely independent pack now.',

A programmer art pack is planned to be announced after the full release of the main 32x pack, after which you\'ll be able to submit textures like you would to the jappa pack. You can already start texturing now if you want, but be aware that your textures won\'t get added into any pack for some time, and that you might end up remaking a texture that we will decide not to include.',

If you\'ve done that or feel like you don\'t require feedback, post your texture as a __plain PNG image__ in <#773987409993793546>, and title it in this format: `<texture_name> (<optional comment>)` + tag co-authors. In these channels your texture will undergo a 3-day public voting period. If it receieves more upvote reactions than downvote reactions, your texture gets passed on to the Texture Supervision Council that will vote on your texture depending on if it fits the general stylistic direction of our pack. The council has a voting period of 1 day. \nAfter that, if your texture is accepted, it will be posted in <#780507804317384744> and added to the WIP pack on GitHub your texture will then be released included in the pack in the first release after your texture has passed. \nIf your texture is rejected by the council, it gets revoted on by pack contributors in <#780507681987100682> with a voting period of 3 more days. This is the final vote your texture can undergo, and it determines whether it will be accepted or rejected in the same way as other votes. \nYou will be assigned the Contributor role if at least one of your submitted textures ever passes voting. The role should be assigned automatically, but if it isn\'t please alert the moderators using `/modping` so they can take a look at it.',
