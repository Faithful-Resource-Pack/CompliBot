## Bot setup:

**DISCLAIMER: We won't help you rebrand the bot for any other server. If you really want to do that, then you need to figure it out yourself.**

1. Create an app on the **[Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/)**.
2. Go to the **Bot** tab, create a bot and copy its token.
3. Rename `tokens.json.example` in the `json/` folder to `tokens.json`.
4. Paste your token after `token`. Additional information like API tokens and various testing modes can be enabled from there as well.

## API Reference:

This project is heavily developed around our public API. Check out our API documentation at https://api.faithfulpack.net/docs for more information about endpoints and making requests.

## Translating:

Many messages shown throughout the bot can be translated into users' native languages for easier usage. Our translation service is powered by Crowdin, [and you can start translating there](https://faithful.crowdin.com/complibot) by clicking on your language in the list. All languages that Discord supports should be listed there.
