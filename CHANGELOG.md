# Changelog

## [v2.0.0]
> This is a beta and will not be stable. To report any bugs, use `/feedback`
### Added

- New easter eggs _(with ones based of images now; if you know you know)_
- Native translation based on discord language for **ALL** commands currently implemented, requires no setup and is maintained by community translators _many thanks for those who contributed so far :D_

### Changed

- Tile command now has a random option to mimick bedrock texture randomization,
`flip` behaves like stone; randomly flips textures. `rotate`
randomly rotates textures at 90deg intervals behaves like moss.
Random options can be applied to all patterns

- Texture command now uses select menus instead of reactions which were slow and unreliable. Ui for the embed has also changed for the better providing useful information and the image both large and in its original size for easier copy.

- Image searching for all image commands now can follow reply chains to the original image. Perfect for long discussions about textures.

- Better feedback, now reports will be sorted into bugs and suggestions which is easier for us devs but also provides a chance to preview your feedback before submitting it

### Removed

- Outdated regular commands and replaced by fancy new slash commands
which are simple to code and maintain plus are both easier to use (especially on mobile) and
show a detailed description of commands and their options.

- Reaction menus. Everyone hates them. Buttons are cool and fast.

### Planned

#### [v2.1.0]
- full implementation of missing commands
- slash command image attachments (we are waiting on discord.js v14 to drop)
#### [v2.2.0]

#### [v2.3.0]

- Instapassing and Invalid working
#### [release] 
- End of "Complibot Beta", will be reincarnated as "Complibot" and the old will become the new
