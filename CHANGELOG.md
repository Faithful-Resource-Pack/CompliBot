# Changelog

## [v2.0.0] 14/02/2002
> This is a beta and will not be fully stable. To report any bugs, use `/feedback`
### Added

- Slash commands (replacing normal commands)
- Buttons and selection menus (replacing reactions)
- Native translations based on Discord language
- `/stats command` command to see the amount of uses of a specific command
- `/license` command for the Compliance Resource Pack license
- Lots of new easter eggs

### Changed

- Tile command now has a random option to mimic minecraft texture randomization,
`flip` behaves like stone; randomly flips textures. `rotate`
randomly rotates textures at 90deg intervals behaves like moss.
Random options can be applied to all patterns
- `/mute` command now uses Discord's timeout feature
- Image searching for all image commands now can follow reply chains to the original image. Perfect for long discussions about textures.
- Image commands now support many new Discord image types, especially for embeds
- Better feedback command, reports will now be sorted into bugs and suggestions which is easier for us devs but also provides a chance to preview your feedback before submitting it
- Improved error logging, which will help us fix bugs faster in the future
- Various changes, tweaks and enhancements to all commands
