        "question": "What is Faithful? How did it come to be?",
        "answer": "Faithful is a project spanning several Minecraft resource packs bearing the same name. The aim of Faithful is to provide a higher-resolution experience while still maintaining the look and feel of the vanilla textures.\nFaithful was originally started by Vattic in 2010, and since then he has given the current Faithful administration the authority to maintain and update the pack officially.",

    {
        "question": "What were the Compliance and Emulated Vattic projects?",
        "answer": "The Faithful project was initially called Compliance, prior to when we had received approval from Vattic to continue Faithful under his brand. In addition, Classic Faithful was an entirely separate project called Emulated Vattic Textures (EM for short), but merged with the Faithful Project and adopted the Classic Faithful name during the Faithful rebrand.\nEssentially, Faithful and Compliance are one and the same, and Classic Faithful and Emulated Vattic are also one and the same.",

        "question": "Who is Kraineff, who is Vattic, and why are there two Faithfuls?",
        "answer": "Vattic, the original creator of Faithful 32x32, left the project in 2016 following real-life difficulties. An artist named Kraineff (formerly xMrVizzy) soon took over, claiming Vattic gave him ownership.\nIn November 2020, Kraineff's history of poor management culminated in an exodus of Faithful contributors, who formed their own community-run project called Compliance. Soon after, these contributors gained contact with Vattic, confirming that Kraineff had falsely claimed ownership and moreover had been profiting off a stolen name for years. With Vattic's blessing, Compliance rebranded to Faithful despite Kraineff refusing to give up the name, thus leading to both projects sharing the same name.\nFor more details, watch AntVenom's video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgZYBTlwaVs).",

        "question": "Can Faithful be installed on consoles?",
        "answer": "There are methods of installing custom resource packs on consoles, but they're very unreliable and change often as it's not officially supported behavior. There's no universal method that will work for everyone and hacky workarounds will probably be needed, sometimes even involving paid file managers. You may have luck searching up methods for an individual console online but results are not guaranteed and may stop working in the future.",

        "question": "When will Faithful be available for [Minecraft version]?",
        "answer": "Since Faithful is a community-driven project, progress is dependent on people submitting textures. This means that there are no hard deadlines for a given pack to be completed for a new version. However, you can usually use an [experimental build](https://database.faithfulpack.net/packs/) of the pack in the mean time, which may include missing textures.\nIf you want to help out with pack progress, read the [Contributor's Handbook](https://docs.faithfulpack.net/pages/manuals/contributor-handbook) and inquire in the pack's respective Discord for more information.",

        "answer": "The version of Faithful 32x previously listed on the Bedrock Marketplace was unauthorized and had been monetizing our stolen work, so we contacted Mojang to remove it.\nUnfortunately, publishing Faithful legitimately on the marketplace is complicated if not impossible due to restrictions surrounding free and contributor-led projects. We would like to eventually release Faithful there if possible, but only if it can remain free for all.",

        "answer": "The difference is in the art style, not in the textures that are being upscaled. Faithful has a more modern, detailed approach to redrawing textures, while Classic Faithful attempts to follow Vattic's art style from the original Faithful 32x32 as closely as possible, opting for a more brushed, smooth appearance.",

        "answer": "JAPPA is the online nickname of Jasper Boerstra, Minecraft's art director and the author of the majority of textures used in versions 1.14 and newer. The \"new\" Minecraft textures are often called Jappa textures in his honour.\nProgrammer Art (oftentimes abbreviated as \"progart\" or \"PA\") is the name given by Mojang and used by the Minecraft artist community for the old textures, used in Minecraft prior to release 1.14. It's also the name of the built-in resource pack featured in newer versions that contains the old textures.\n*Whether a texture is Jappa or Programmer Art is not related to its pixel resolution (e.g. 16x16, 32x, 64x).*",

    },
    {
        "question": "What is the difference between 16x, 32x, and 64x?",
        "answer": "\"32x\" means the textures, as a base, are 32 by 32 pixels (rather than default's 16 by 16 pixels). \"64x\" means the textures are 64 by 64 pixels. Higher numbers mean higher resolution textures. While these values are technically arbitrary, anything other than powers of two can cause issues in-game.\n*The pixel resolution of the textures aren't related to whether they are \"Jappa\" or \"Programmer Art\".*",

There are plans for a modern Faithful-styled Programmer Art pack in the future, but for the time being all programmer art packs are based on the original Faithful art from that time period.",

        "question": "Does Faithful offer any resolutions above 64x?",
        "answer": "The simple answer is no. The amount of effort required for a 128x or 256x pack increases exponentially compared with our highest-supported resolution currently, 64x, and the difference in-game becomes harder and harder to notice. There are \"Faithful\" packs that may have higher resolution textures, but these aren't official or endorsed by us so your mileage may vary.",

Any text you include with the message will be added as a comment, and people pinged in the comment will be added as co-authors.\nFor a texture to be added to the pack, it must pass a round of community voting (lasting 2 days) and a round of private Art Director Council voting (lasting one day).

Their website that hosts the textures still exists at http://f32.me/, but goes down often (it has most likely gone down indefinitely at the time of writing). Currently, the most reliable place to get the old Faithful mod textures is [the F32Organization GitHub](https://github.com/F32Organization).\nWe used to host these textures on our website as well, but over time our mod picker broke down, leading to us removing them.
