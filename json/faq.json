        "question": "What is Faithful? How did it come to be?",
        "answer": "Faithful is a project spanning several Minecraft resource packs bearing the same name. The aim of Faithful is to provide a higher-resolution experience while still maintaining the look and feel of the vanilla textures.\nFaithful was originally started by Vattic in 2010, and since then he has given the current Faithful administration the authority to maintain and update the pack officially.",

    {
        "question": "What were the Compliance and Emulated Vattic projects?",
        "answer": "The Faithful project was initially called Compliance, prior to when we had received approval from Vattic to continue Faithful under his brand. In addition, Classic Faithful was an entirely separate project called Emulated Vattic Textures (EM for short), but merged with the Faithful Project and adopted the Classic Faithful name during the Faithful rebrand.\nEssentially, Faithful and Compliance are one and the same, and Classic Faithful and Emulated Vattic are also one and the same.",

        "question": "Who is Kraineff, who is Vattic, and why are there two Faithfuls?",
        "answer": "The original creator of the Faithful 32x32 resource pack, Vattic, abandoned the project in 2016 due to unfortunate and uncontrollable life circumstances. A few months after, an artist named Kraineff (also known as xMrVizzy) began maintaining Faithful, claiming Vattic gave him ownership of the project.\nAs Kraineff made increasingly questionable management decisions, people began questioning his legitimacy, and eventually the majority of his community left in November 2020 for their own community-run project, Compliance. Soon after, these contributors gained contact with Vattic after four years, who confirmed Kraineff had been profiting off a stolen name for years. This is documented in AntVenom's video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgZYBTlwaVs) if you want more information.\nDespite having been exposed as a thief, Kraineff still refused to relinquish the Faithful name. The now-official Compliance project decided to rebrand to Faithful regardless, causing there to be two Faithfuls.",

        "answer": "There are methods of installing custom resource packs on consoles, but they're very unreliable and change often as it's not officially supported behavior. There's no universal method that will work for everyone and hacky workarounds will probably be needed, sometimes even involving paid file managers. You may have luck searching up methods for an individual console online but results are not guaranteed and may stop working in the future.",

    {
        "question": "When will Faithful be available for [Minecraft version]?",
        "answer": "Since Faithful is a community-driven project, progress is dependent on people submitting textures. This means that there are no hard deadlines for a given pack to be completed for a new version. However, you can usually use an [experimental build](https://database.faithfulpack.net/packs/) of the pack in the mean time, which may include missing textures.\nIf you want to help out with pack progress, read the [Contributor's Handbook](https://docs.faithfulpack.net/pages/manuals/contributor-handbook) and inquire in the pack's respective Discord for more information.",

        "answer": "The previously listed version of Faithful 32x on the Bedrock marketplace (by Kraineff/xMrVizzy) was never official or licensed by us. As the stolen pack contained mostly our work, we contacted Mojang to take the pack off the marketplace since it was monetizing stolen work.\nUnfortunately, getting our resource packs onto the marketplace would be a lengthy and complicated process, since a free pack hasn't been published to the marketplace before. On top of this, community packs are disallowed from the marketplace, as there would be no fair way to compensate everyone involved otherwise monetarily. We would like to eventually release Faithful on the marketplace if possible, but if releasing a free resource pack on the marketplace is not possible, we will not release Faithful there.",

        "question": "What's the difference between Faithful and Classic Faithful?",
        "answer": "The difference is in the art style, not in the textures that are being upscaled. Faithful has a more modern, detailed approach to redrawing textures, while Classic Faithful attempts to follow Vattic's art style from the original Faithful 32x32 as closely as possible, opting for a more brushed, smooth appearance.",

        "question": "What are Jappa and Programmer Art textures?",
        "answer": "JAPPA is the online nickname of Jasper Boerstra, Minecraft's art director and the author of the majority of textures used in versions 1.14 and newer. The \"new\" Minecraft textures are often called Jappa textures in his honour.\nProgrammer Art (oftentimes abbreviated as \"progart\" or \"PA\") is the name given by Mojang and used by the Minecraft artist community for the old textures, used in Minecraft prior to release 1.14. It's also the name of the built-in resource pack featured in newer versions that contains the old textures.\n*Whether a texture is Jappa or Programmer Art is not related to its pixel resolution (e.g. 16x16, 32x, 64x).*",

    {
        "question": "What is the difference between 16x, 32x, and 64x?",
        "answer": "\"32x\" means the textures, as a base, are 32 by 32 pixels (rather than default's 16 by 16 pixels). \"64x\" means the textures are 64 by 64 pixels. Higher numbers mean higher resolution textures. While these values are technically arbitrary, anything other than powers of two can cause issues in-game.\n*The pixel resolution of the textures aren't related to whether they are \"Jappa\" or \"Programmer Art\".*",

        "question": "Does Faithful offer any resolutions above 64x?",
        "answer": "The simple answer is no. The amount of effort required for a 128x or 256x pack increases exponentially compared with our highest-supported resolution currently, 64x, and the difference in-game becomes harder and harder to notice. There are \"Faithful\" packs that may have higher resolution textures, but these aren't official or endorsed by us so your mileage may vary.",

Any text you include with the message will be added as a comment, and people pinged in the comment will be added as co-authors.\nFor a texture to be added to the pack, it must pass a round of community voting (lasting 2 days) and a round of private Art Director Council voting (lasting one day).

Currently, the most reliable place to get the old Faithful mod textures is [the F32Organization GitHub](https://github.com/F32Organization).\nWe used to host these textures on our website as well, but over time our mod picker broke down, leading to us removing them. When the time is right, we intend to group the old F32Org textures with Classic Faithful 32x and give them a mod picker on the rewritten website alongside the new Faithful 32x mod support.",

Examples: 3D items, Consistent Bedrock.\n**Add-on**: An add-on adds new features to the game, and/or is usually larger in scope than a tweak. Examples: New random variations for blocks/mobs.\nAdditionally, due to technical limitations, PBR resource packs cannot reuse textures from the main Faithful pack, and therefore can function as standalone, but for the sake of simplicity, they are also considered add-ons.\nLastly, collections of tweaks that the author chooses not to submit individually are considered add-ons as well.",

While ludicrously high-resolution packs may cause a minor decrease (well above the scope of the Faithful project), in general shaders or mods are the major graphics-related culprit for causing large amounts of lag, not resource packs.
