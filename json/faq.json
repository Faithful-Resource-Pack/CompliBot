        "question": "What is Faithful? How did it come to be?",
        "answer": "Faithful is a project spanning several Minecraft resource packs bearing the same name. The aim of Faithful is to provide a higher-resolution experience while still maintaining the look and feel of the vanilla textures.\nFaithful was originally started by Vattic in 2010, and since then he has given the current Faithful administration the authority to maintain and update the pack officially.",

        "question": "What were the Compliance and Emulated Vattic projects?",
        "answer": "The Faithful project was initially called Compliance, prior to when we had received approval from Vattic to continue Faithful under his brand. In addition, Classic Faithful was an entirely separate project called Emulated Vattic Textures (EM for short), but merged with the Faithful Project and adopted the Classic Faithful name during the Faithful rebrand.\nEssentially, Faithful and Compliance are one and the same, and Classic Faithful and Emulated Vattic are also one and the same.",

        "question": "Who is Kraineff, who is Vattic, and why are there two Faithfuls?",
        "answer": "Vattic, the original creator of Faithful 32x32, left the project in 2016 following real-life difficulties. An artist named Kraineff (formerly xMrVizzy) soon took over, claiming Vattic gave him ownership.\nIn November 2020, Kraineff's history of poor management culminated in an exodus of Faithful contributors, who formed their own community-run project called Compliance. Soon after, these contributors gained contact with Vattic, confirming that Kraineff had falsely claimed ownership and moreover had been profiting off a stolen name for years. With Vattic's blessing, Compliance rebranded to Faithful despite Kraineff refusing to give up the name, thus leading to both projects sharing the same name.\nFor more details, watch AntVenom's video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgZYBTlwaVs).",

There's no universal method that will work for everyone and hacky workarounds will probably be needed, sometimes even involving paid file managers. You may have luck searching up methods for an individual console online but results are not guaranteed and may stop working in the future.",

We would like to eventually release Faithful there if possible, but only if it can remain completely free.",

The \"new\" Minecraft textures are often called Jappa textures in his honour.\nProgrammer Art (oftentimes abbreviated as \"progart\" or \"PA\") is the name given by Mojang and used by the Minecraft artist community for the old textures, used in Minecraft prior to release 1.14. It's also the name of the built-in resource pack featured in newer versions that contains the old textures.\n*Whether a texture is Jappa or Programmer Art is not related to its pixel resolution (e.g. 16x16, 32x, 64x).*",

        "answer": "\"32x\" means the textures, as a base, are 32 by 32 pixels (rather than default's 16 by 16 pixels). \"64x\" means the textures are 64 by 64 pixels. Higher numbers mean higher resolution textures. While these values are technically arbitrary, anything other than powers of two can cause issues in-game.\n*The pixel resolution of the textures aren't related to whether they are \"Jappa\" or \"Programmer Art\".*",

        "answer": "The simple answer is no. The amount of effort required for a 128x or 256x pack increases exponentially compared with our highest-supported resolution currently, 64x, and the difference in-game becomes harder and harder to notice. There are \"Faithful\" packs that may have higher resolution textures, but these aren't official or endorsed by us so your mileage may vary.",

Any text you include with the message will be added as a comment, and people pinged in the comment will be added as co-authors.\nFor a texture to be added to the pack, it must pass a round of community voting (lasting 2 days).

Currently, the most reliable place to get the old Faithful mod textures is [the F32Organization GitHub](https://github.com/F32Organization).\nWe used to host these textures on our website as well, but over time our mod picker broke down, leading to us removing them.
