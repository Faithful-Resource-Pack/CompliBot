			"description": "Not knowing these is not an excuse for misbehaving, and you can and will be held accountable for your actions. Punishments are up to the discretion of the moderators, and harassing them is only going to make your punishment worse.\n\n*Use `e!modping` or directly ping an online moderator if rules are being broken. **Please do not mini-mod!***"

			"title": "1Ô∏è‚É£ Read & Follow Discord‚Äôs Terms of Service and Community Guidelines",
			"description": "You can find them at https://discord.com/terms and https://discord.com/guidelines respectively. This includes misuse of client modifications (e.g. message loggers) and discussion or promotion of illegal activity."

		{
			"title": "2Ô∏è‚É£ Use Common Sense",
			"description": "This is the generic \"don‚Äôt be an idiot\" rule. Prohibited actions include raiding or brigading other servers, using hate speech or slurs, joking about tragedies or other sensitive topics, and spreading misinformation."

			"title": "3Ô∏è‚É£ Speak English",
			"description": "People and by extension moderators can't know what you're saying otherwise, as this is an English-speaking server. Please use a [translator](https://www.deepl.com/translator) if you cannot fluently understand English."
		},
		{
			"title": "4Ô∏è‚É£ Be Constructive and Polite",
			"description": "Give constructive criticism people can use to improve their work, not just say that something is ugly or bad. Swearing is allowed within reason, however don‚Äôt cross the line into harassment."

		{
			"title": "5Ô∏è‚É£ Try to Not Annoy Others",
			"description": "This includes overly (reply) pinging, sending loud audio or seizure-inducing videos without a spoiler/disclaimer, and abusing nicknames, reactions, or spoilers. Don‚Äôt [ask to ask](https://dontasktoask.com), instead just ask your question directly to save everybody time."
		},
		{
			"title": "6Ô∏è‚É£ Don‚Äôt Clutter Chats",
			"description": "While short tangents are fine, we have multiple channels for a reason, so please use them as intended. Spamming random things, including emojis and stickers, or starting a chat chain contributes nothing to a conversation and only causes a mess."
		},
		{
			"title": "7Ô∏è‚É£ Avoid NSFW and NSFL Content",
			"description": "This includes, but is not limited to pornography, gore, and overly gross content; if you think it‚Äôs against the rules it probably will be. DM a moderator for approval if you‚Äôre very unsure."
		},
		{
			"title": "8Ô∏è‚É£ Stay Away From Political Discussion",
			"description": "General discussion about real-life events is still allowed from a more neutral perspective. If you really want to discuss politics, take it to a DM or another server."

		{
			"title": "9Ô∏è‚É£ No Unsolicited Promoting or Advertising",
			"description": "Any sort of advertising that is not in context or clearly solicited is disallowed. Spamming or DM messaging advertisements will get you reported to Discord and banned from the servers."
		},
		{
			"title": "üîü Don‚Äôt Leak Private Information",
			"description": "What happens in private channels stays in those channels; keep any confidential information you may have private. Doxxing will get you reported to Discord and banned from the servers."
